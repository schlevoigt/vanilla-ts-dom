# Vanilla.ts

Web UIs with pure TypeScript.

Opinionated, highly experimental, unfinished. Don't use.

*DOM module*, requires [vanilla-ts-core](https://github.com/mn4367/vanilla-ts-core).

Currrently a directory sructure like this is required:

```
<parent-dir>
  |- vanilla-ts-core
  |- vanilla-ts-dom
```
